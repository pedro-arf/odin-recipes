      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Caldo verde is one of my favorite Portuguese recipes. This creamy soup
        made with linguiça sausage and potatoes is greenish in color thanks to a
        whole pound of fresh kale.
      </p>
      <p>Enjoy it with a thick slice of your favorite bread.</p>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook for 3 minutes. Add potatoes and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Pour in water and bring to a boil; boil gently until potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook sausage in a large skillet over medium-low heat until it has released most of its fat, about 10 minutes. Drain. </li>
        <li>Use an immersion blender to purée potato mixture. Stir in sausage and season with salt and pepper. Increase the heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in kale and simmer until tender and bright green, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and serve immediately. </li>
      </ol>
