      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This a traditional Portuguese way of cooking codfish, from the capital
        city of Lisbon. In a country with a large tradition of making codfish in
        several ways, this is, for me, the most delicious and sinful way of
        eating this wonderful fish.

      <p>Taste it and you will see!</p>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Soak the dried salted cod in cold water with the skin side up for 24
          hours, changing the water about 4 times. Drain and discard the water.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Place the cod in a pan with enough water to cover; bring to a boil and
          cook for 10 minutes. Remove the cod from the pan; remove and discard
          the skin and bones. Cut the cod into chunks and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.
          Working in batches if necessary, fry the potatoes in the hot oil until
          just cooked, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper
          towels to drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the olive oil into a Dutch oven or heat-proof casserole dish over
          medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the oil until the onion is
          translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the cod and cook another 3 minutes;
          stir the potatoes into the mixture and cook another 1 to 2 minutes.
          Reduce heat to low.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt the butter in a separate pan over medium-low heat; vigorously
          stir the flour into the melted butter. Slowly stream the hot milk into
          the mixture while stirring; cook and stir until thick. Season with the
          nutmeg. Pour into the casserole with 1 1/3 cups cream; stir to coat.
          Allow the mixture to simmer together for about 2 minutes. Season with
          salt and pepper. Drizzle remaining 2/3 cup cream over the mixture;
          sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned, 30 to 40 minutes.
          Serve hot.
        </li>
